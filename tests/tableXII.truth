# Reconstructed from Table XII in McCluskey56.
#
# Interestingly, we find A.D.F as a minimal sum whereas
# McCluskey only found minimal sums with 3 components,
# having different basis than here...
#
# A1 = 1--0
# B1 = 0-01
# C1 = -000
# D1 = -101
# E1 = 110-
# F1 = 000-
#
# A1.(B1.(C1.(D1 + E1) + E1.F1) + D1.F1)
#
# c.f. McCluskey
#
# A = 1--0 ~ A1
# B = 00-0
# C = 000- ~ F1
# D = 11-0
# E = 110- ~ E1
# F = -101 ~ D1
#
# A . C . F . (D + E)
# ~ A1 . F1 . D1 . (D + E1)
#
# note that D is fully covered by A . E but is
# clearly not equivalent to our solution.
#
# The only reason I have for this is that McCluskey may have
# made a mistake when constructing the Table of Prime Implicants
# because he didn't go back to the underlying truth table.
