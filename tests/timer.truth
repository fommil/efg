#
# The standard solution uses AND, OR and INV (3 chips) but he alse gives a
# version using NAND (2 chips) and that can be replaced with NAND and INV (2
# chips). We also have the option of a free INV on the S input.
#
# Inputs are
#
# A - automatic clock
# S - signal to choose between auto and manual
# M - manual clock (step debugger)
# H - HaLT that can come from the program.
