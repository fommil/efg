# Example from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm
# which contains d-terms (i.e. don't cares). The standard answer without
# considering d-terms is
#
# A = 1-11
# B = -100
# C = 10-0
# D = 1-00
# E = 101-
# A.B.(C + D.E)
#
# but with d-terms it is
#
# A = 10--
# B = -100
# C = 1-1-
# A.B.C
