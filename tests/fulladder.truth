# Full Adder (2 bits and carry flag)
#
# The minimal sum of products
#
# A = 11-
# B = 1-1
# C = -11
# D = 111
# E = 100
# F = 010
# G = 001
#
# Co = A.B.C
# S = D.E.F.G
#
# is far from multi-level solutions comprised of 2-bit
# AND, OR, XOR, NOR and NAND, e.g.
#
# tmp = XOR(A, B)
# S = XOR(tmp, Cin)
# Co = OR(AND(tmp, Cin), AND(A, B))
#
# (XOR may also be replaced with NOR)
#
# A B Ci | Co S
