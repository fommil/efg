# truth table reconstructed from TableXII of McCluskey
# from the minimal sum of products. Note that (a) has
# a typo in the definition of A, which is correctly
# described in (c).
#
# A = --10 (not 1--0)
# B = 00-0
# C = 000-
# D = 11-0
# E = 110-
# F = -101
#
# A . C . F . (D + E)
#
# We get the longer form
#
# A = --10
# B = 0-01
# C = 00-0
# D = -101
# E = 11-0
# F = 110-
# G = 000-

# A.(B.(C.(D.E + F) + F.G) + D.E.G)
