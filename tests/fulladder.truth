# Full Adder (2 bits and carry flag)
#
# Normally written as a multi-level circuit comprised of 2-bit
# AND, OR, XOR, NOR and NAND, e.g.
#
# tmp = XOR(A, B)
# Co = OR(AND(tmp, Cin), AND(A, B))
# S = XOR(tmp, Cin)
#
# i.e.
#
# (C . (A ^ B)) + A . B
# (A ^ B) ^ C
#
# which isn't necessarilly the most efficient implementation.
#
# Note that S is also an XOR3(A, B, Cin) where XOR is viewed
# as a parity checker rather than an "exclusive OR". Which
# is best viewed as two chained XOR gates.
